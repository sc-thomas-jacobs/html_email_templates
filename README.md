# 📬 HTML Email Templates Repository

Welcome to the Schools' Choice HTML Email Templates repository. This project serves as a centralized, version-controlled archive for all email templates used across our services — from employee notifications to system alerts.

## ✨ Purpose

This repository ensures:
- Consistent branding and layout across all email communications
- Easy access to current and archived templates
- Scalable and maintainable HTML structures optimized for email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.)

## 📁 Repository Structure

To be added.

## 🧩 Self-Service Emails

This section contains templates triggered by employee actions via the Self-Service portal, including:

- **Header & Footer**: Shared across all templates for consistent branding
- **Sickness Notification**: Current and legacy versions
- **Archived Versions**: Retained for reference and rollback

All templates are:
- Mobile-friendly
- Tested in Outlook and Gmail
- Structured with inline styles for maximum compatibility

## 🛠 Development Notes

- Use `max-width: 600px` containers for scalability
- Inline all CSS for reliable rendering
- Avoid external fonts and background images
- Use HTML attributes (`width`, `height`) for image sizing
- Spacer rows (`<td height="30">`) preferred over `margin-top`

## 📌 Contributing

If you're updating or adding templates:
1. Use semantic HTML and inline styles
2. Test in major email clients before committing
3. Document changes clearly in commit messages
4. Archive old versions in `/archived` with version suffixes
